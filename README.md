# Avacado Leaf Disease Dataset - Kaithala (Tamil Nadu)

The Avocado Image Dataset consists of 435 raw images showcasing both healthy and disease-infected avocados, with 216 images depicting avocados affected by various diseases and 219 images representing healthy specimens. Prior to annotation, the dataset underwent a splitting process with a ratio of 7:2:1 for training, validation, and testing respectively. Post-processing, all images were resized to 224x224 pixels. Annotation techniques, including vertical flipping, 90-degree rotation, and shearing, were exclusively applied during the training phase to enhance dataset diversity. The augmented dataset distribution across training, validation, and testing sets is outlined, showcasing a balanced representation of both healthy and diseased avocado images.
